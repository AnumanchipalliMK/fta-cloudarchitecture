# Azure Architecture

This presentation is about architecture design in the Cloud. This is important because the way we design solutions in the cloud has a large impact on things like scalability, cost, performance, security and management. Making good architecture decisions during the design and requirements phase helps us to be more successful in Cloud and to have a more awesome experience once we are in Production.

## Outline v2

* Cloud Architecture (role, practice)
* Bringing business requirements to the design process
  * Service selection
  * Requirements mapping to features
  * What's important to various Personas
* Fundamentals, economics, elasticity, loose coupling, eventual consisitency
* The Well-Architecture Framework
  * FKA AAF, FKA Azure Application Guide, FKA P&P...
* Reliability
  * Walk through the review? 
* Operational Excellence
* Cost optimization??

## Outline of today's session

* What do you mean "Cloud Architect" [cloud-solution-architect.md](docs/cloud-solution-architect.md)
* Why is it different in cloud [cloud-fundamentals.md](docs/cloud-fundamentals.md)
* Cloud design patterns (a glimpse)[cloud-design-patterns.md](docs/cloud-design-patterns.md)
* Anti-patterns [anti-patterns.md](docs/anti-patterns.md)
* The importance of requirements
* The domination of agile
* Keep across the change
* Resliency and Business Continuity

## Goals of this session

* To familiarise Engineers with the Architect role and practice
* To understand how cloud architecture is different from traditional forms of architecture, and where it is similar
* To demonstrate how Engineers and Architects can use the Azure Architecture centre, the Well-architected framework, 
  Cloud adoption framework in their daily work
* To familiarise Engineers and Architects with training resources like Microsoft Learn

## Who Should Attend?

*  I am designing a solution for the cloud
*  I am building my organisations cloud strategy
*  I need a useful reference to shame my peers' poor habits

## What are the prerequesites

*  Basic understanding of Software Archeticture Principles e.g Resiliency, Requirements, Business continuity
*

Give a short description for your sample here. What does it do and why is it important?

## Contents

Outline the file contents of the repository. It helps users navigate the codebase, build configuration and any related assets.

| File/folder       | Description                                |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `src`             | Sample source code.                        |
| `.gitignore`      | Define what to ignore at commit time.      |
| `CHANGELOG.md`    | List of changes to the sample.             |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Guidelines for contributing to the sample. |
| `README.md`       | This README file.                          |
| `LICENSE`         | The license for the sample.                |

## Prerequisites

Outline the required components and tools that a user might need to have on their machine in order to run the sample. This can be anything from frameworks, SDKs, OS versions or IDE releases.

## Setup

Explain how to prepare the sample once the user clones or downloads the repository. The section should outline every step necessary to install dependencies and set up any settings (for example, API keys and output folders).

## Running the sample

Outline step-by-step instructions to execute the sample and see its output. Include steps for executing the sample from the IDE, starting specific services in the Azure portal or anything related to the overall launch of the code.

## Key concepts

Provide users with more context on the tools and services used in the sample. Explain some of the code that is being used and how services interact with each other.
