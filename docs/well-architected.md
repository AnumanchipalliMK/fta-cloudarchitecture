# Azure architecture center

> **[prev]** | **[home]**  | **[next]**

The [Azure architecture center] is a rich resource for cloud architects and engineers. Contained in its pages are patterns and practices learned from decades of building global scale applications and operating cloud-scale infrastructure and services. FastTrack engineers use this resource every day; all of our advice is backed by the Azure architecture center and the greater Microsoft docs site. Azure architecture is opensource and contributions are welcomed from the community.
