# Cloud solution architecture

A Solution Architect is someone who assists teams to design solutions that are fit for purpose. In the
cloud this role is known as a "Cloud solution architect". In many teams Architect is a role, not a job
title. It's important that every engineer puts their "Architect" hat on from time to time.
