# Architecture in the cloud

> **[prev]** | **[home]**  | **[next]**

Solution architecture is concerned with the planning, design, implementation, and ongoing improvement of a technology system. The architecture of a system must balance and align the business requirements with the technical capabilities that are needed to execute those requirements. The finished architecture is a balance of risk, cost, and capability throughout the system and its components.

## The role of the Architect

A Solution Architect is someone who assists teams to design solutions that are fit for purpose. In the cloud this role is known as a "Cloud solution architect". In many teams Architect is a role, not a job title. It's important that every engineer puts their "Architect" hat on from time to time.

## Architecture design session

Good practices in the design phase help to reduce issues in later phases of a system's life. While it is important to think about requirements in the early stage we should be careful not to fall into the trap of [Big Design Up Front] (BDUF); our design should evolve and the process should continue until the end of the system's life. In the next section we will learn why requirements are so important for design. This will be a recurring theme throughout this 1:many session.
