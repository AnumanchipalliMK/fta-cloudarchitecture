# Requirements, requirements, requirements

Running a solution in the cloud doesn't reduce the need for your requirements to be clear. In fact, the flexibility and power provided by the cloud means that it's even more important to have clear requirements from business stakeholders; otherwise, you could end up solving for problems that don't exist, missing an important design decision, or going beyond the available budget by adding unnecessary resiliency.

Some key requirements that should be gathered upfront include:

* Who will the users of the solution be? Where are they physically located?
* What sort of request volumes will be seen? Are there targets for throughput and response times?
* How important is this solution to the business? Are there defined SLAs for uptime and availability?
* What is the impact of the solution being unavailable? Are there options for business continuity?
* What is the budget available - for development, operations, and running cloud resources?
* Does the business have compliance standards, cloud policies, or security policies that need to be followed?
* Who will operate the system in production? What visibility do they need into its components?
