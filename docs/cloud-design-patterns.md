# Cloud design patterns

> **[prev]** | **[home]**  | **[next]**

The Azure Architecture Center contains a large number of design patterns that explain how common
problems can be solved with cloud architecture. There are a large number of patterns that span
several types of considerations including reliability, performance, and managing complex
deployments.

In this section we will briefly examine a few of the patterns that relate to the fundamental
concepts we explored in the previous section.
