# Azure Architecture Center

> **[prev]** | **[home]**  | **[next]**

The [Azure Architecture Center] is a rich resource for cloud architects and engineers. Contained in its pages are patterns and practices learned from decades of building global scale applications and operating cloud-scale infrastructure and services. FastTrack engineers use this resource every day; all of our advice is backed by the Azure architecture center and the greater Microsoft docs site. Azure architecture is opensource and contributions are welcomed from the community.

## Application Architecture Guide
The Application Architecture Guide as a great resource for answering some of the big upfront questions that face architects. It guides the reader through different style of architecture illuminating the benfits and challanges of each style. The resourse is great for Any who is just starting the design process.

### Reference architectures
We have created a number of reference architecture across a wide number of solution areas. A great starting point for any architecture design session. Find a reference architecture/s that overlap with your solution. Use what makes sense. Use the ARM templates (if provided) in github to start your automation early.

## Design patterns

The Azure Architecture Center contains a [Cloud Design Patterns] section that explain how common
problems can be solved with cloud architecture. There are a large number of patterns that span
several types of considerations including reliability, performance, and managing complex
deployments.

## Well-Architected Framework
The inspiration of this discussion. The Well architected framework lays out key tenants in a series of pillars and provides guidance on technology choices and even provides a check list for each pillar. Our recommendation is to read the guide before starting a design session and use the checklists at the end as a measure.
